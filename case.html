Heat generated by the reaction, chloroform concentrations higher than normal and the presence of an iron catalyst caused by the corrosion of the stainless steel tank wall, resulted in the opening of the safety valve.

    <p>The Morbi Bridge collapse would not have occurred if the rusty cable of the suspension bridge had been repaired</p>
    <p>The observations were made by Superintendent of Police P. A. Zala, who made his testimony to a local court. On the evening of October 30, 135 people perished in the Morbi ridge collapse.
    </p>
    <p>A cable supported the bridge. and there was no oiling or greasing of the cable, according to the statement The cable had corroded from the point where it snapped. This incident would not have occurred if the cable had been repaired.
    </p>
    <p>The bridge was allowed to open on October 26 without calculating the allowable capacity and without official consent. The engineering team that looked for clues to the collapse claimed that the choice of materials might have contributed to the structure's vulnerability by increasing its weight, implying that refurbishment, if any, was restricted to the hanging portion of the bridge. 
    </p>
    <p>The likelihood of the cables snapping increased because there were significantly more people on the bridge than was safe at the time of its collapse.

    <h3 id="ccs">The Changing Color of Statue of Liberty</h3>
    <img src="D:\c\sol.jpg" alt="" id="sol">
    <p>Corrosion is often a slow change and can be observed over a great period of time. The iconic bluish-green Statue of Liberty on the Liberty island of the New York Harbor, USA is a great example of such an observation.
    </p>
    <p>When France gifted the Statue of liberty to the US as a way of commemorating the US’s fight for independence in 1886, it was actually brown in color reflecting the shiny copper surface of the skin. Over the next 30 years, though, it slowly turned to the green color you witness today. The change in appearance is a direct consequence of corrosion that took place over this period. The whole phenomenon can be understood by the series of reactions mentioned below:
    </p>
    <p>Initially, the copper went under oxidation reaction by donating its electrons to the oxygen present in the air. This led to the formation of a reddish-pink oxide mineral known as cuprite or copper (I) oxide ({Cu}_{2}{O}Cu2​O).2CuCu +{O}_{2}O2​ → {Cu}_{2}{O}Cu2​O
    </p>
    <p>Then the copper(I) oxide continues to react with oxygen to form copper oxide (CuO), which is black in color 
      <p>2{Cu}_{2}{O}Cu2​O+ {O}_{2}O2​ → 4CuOCuO (black)</p>
    </p>
    <p>Also, due to the burning of coal for energy during that time, the air contained a lot of sulfur. As a result, atmospheric sulfur trioxide, carbon dioxide, and water all reacted with the copper oxide as follow: </p> <p>2CuO + {CO}_{2} + {H}_{2}{O} → {Cu}_{2}{CO}_{3}{(OH)}_{2}2CuO+CO2​+H2​O→Cu2​CO3​(OH)2​ (green)</p> <p>3CuO + 2{CO}_{2} + {H}_{2}{O} → {Cu}_{3}{({CO}_{3})}_{2}{(OH)}_{2}3CuO+2CO2​+H2​O→Cu3​(CO3​)2​(OH)2​ (blue)</p><p>4CuO + {SO}_{3} +3{H}_{2}{O} → {Cu}_{4}{SO}_{4}{(OH)}_{6}4CuO+SO3​+3H2​O→Cu4​SO4​(OH)6​ (green)</p>

   
    <p>These three compounds are responsible for the characteristic blue-green patina seen on the Statue of Liberty.
